    steps:
      # 1. Checkout the repo
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # 2. Add MSBuild to PATH (Optional but recommended for cleaner commands)
      # This uses a public action to locate and configure the MSBuild path.
      - name: Setup MSBuild Path
        uses: microsoft/setup-msbuild@v2

      # 3. Restore NuGet Packages
      # Use the Nuget executable found on the Windows runner.

        run: nuget restore fitnessProject.sln
        # NOTE: Replace 'YourSolutionName.sln' with your actual solution file name.
        # If you don't have a solution file, you may need to specify the project path.

      # 4. Build and Publish the ASP.NET Framework application
      # This step uses MSBuild to compile the app and place the output into a 'publish' folder.
      - name: Publish ASP.NET Framework App
        run: |
          # The 'msbuild' command is now available due to the 'setup-msbuild' step
